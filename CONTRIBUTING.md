# Submitting New Catalog Entries

Fork this repository, make your edit to `just-install.json` then submit a pull request.

Guidelines to follow:

- Catalog entries are listed in alphabetical order, make sure yours fit with this scheme.
- Prefer the x86_64 edition of the software:
  + Unless there are several compatibility or support issues (e.g.: Python)
- For development libraries: prefer ones compiled with Visual Studio since it's the native
  toolchain on Windows.
