============

*The stupid package installer for Windows*

Chocolatey, Ninite, Npackd are way too slow, bloated and difficult to extend. I
[needed](http://lorenzo.villani.me/2013/04/08/just-install-my-stuff/) a no-frills
solution to install stuff on Windows machines, here it is.




Installation
------------

Download `just-install.exe` from the
[Releases](https://github.com/lvillani/just-install/releases) page and copy
it to `%SystemRoot%` or some other directory which is in your `%PATH%`.
