Just Install
============

*The stupid package installer for Windows*

Chocolatey, Ninite, Npackd are way too slow, bloated and difficult to extend.
I [needed](http://lorenzo.villani.me/2013/04/08/just-install-my-stuff/) a no-
frills solution to install stuff on Windows machines, here it is.




Installation
------------

Download [just-install.exe](http://github.com/lvillani/just-install/releases/download/latest/just-install.exe)
and double click it. Boom! `just-install` is now in your `%PATH%`. How easy is
that?
