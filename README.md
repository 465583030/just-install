Just Install
============

*The stupid package installer for Windows*

Chocolatey, Ninite, Npackd are way too slow, bloated and difficult to extend. I
[needed](http://lorenzo.villani.me/2013/04/08/just-install-my-stuff/) a no-frills solution to
install stuff on Windows machines, here it is.




Installation
------------

Download [just-install.exe](http://lvillani.github.io/just-install/just-install.exe)
and double click it. Boom! `just-install` is now in your `%PATH%`. How easy is
that?

In a hurry? Here's a quick mnemonic link you can use to bootstrap a new machine:
<http://is.gd/justinstall>. *"Is Good? Just Install!"*, it's easy to remember.
