Just Install
============

*The stupid package installer for Windows*

Chocolatey, Ninite, Npackd are way too slow, bloated and difficult to extend. I
[needed](http://lorenzo.villani.me/2013/04/08/just-install-my-stuff/) a no-frills solution to
install stuff on Windows machines, here it is.




Installation
------------

Download [just-install.exe](http://lvillani.github.io/just-install/just-install.exe)
and double click it. Boom! `just-install` is now in your `%PATH%`. How easy is
that?

In a hurry? Here's a mnemonic link you can use to bootstrap a new machine, just type this in a
browser [is.gd/justinstall](http://is.gd/justinstall). *"Is (it) Good? Just Install!"*.
